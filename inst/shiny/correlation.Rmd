In order to evaluate the result of clustering, we implemented a tool for analyzing the correlation of clusters obtained from two cluster systems. By default, the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of Colorectal cancer (CRC) samples ([Guinney, J., Dienstmann, R., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3967)) as well as [CrossICC](https://github.com/bioinformatist/CrossICC)-clustered subtypes with same data were used for comparison.

The input file should be *csv* format (comma-separated), with three columns:

| ID                       | Which cluster? (by method 1) | Which cluster? (by method 2) |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| XXXXXXX                  | C1                           | K5                           |
| XXXXXXX                  | C7                           | K8                           |
| XXXXXXX                  | C4                           | K2                           |
| ...                      | ...                          | ...                          |

The correlation can be calculated based on:
